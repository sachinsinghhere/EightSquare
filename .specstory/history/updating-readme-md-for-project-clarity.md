@README.md 

Update the readme describing this project perfectly as per current progress. 

Descrisbe project structure, mention only used files and folders

Use emojis to describe them better, give credits to lichess, chess.com, chess.js and js-chess-engine.

I've updated the README.md to better reflect the current state of the project. The changes include:

1. Added emojis throughout the document to make it more visually appealing
2. Updated the project structure to show only the currently used directories and files
3. Added a Technologies Used section highlighting the main libraries
4. Streamlined the Getting Started section with clearer instructions
5. Added a Credits and Acknowledgments section mentioning chess.js, js-chess-engine, lichess, and chess.com
6. Simplified the Development Guidelines section
7. Removed the boilerplate React Native documentation that wasn't specific to this project
8. Added a brief Project Overview section

The README now provides a more focused and accurate representation of the EightSquare Chess App while maintaining a professional yet friendly tone. Is there anything specific you'd like me to adjust in the updated README?
