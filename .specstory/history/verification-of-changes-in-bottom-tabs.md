Have you applied the changes in all the screens ? I can't see the changes in the bottom tabs.

It looks like the bottom tabs are defined in the `BottomTabs.tsx` file located at `src/navigation/bottom-tabs/BottomTabs.tsx`. This file contains the configuration for the bottom tab navigator, including the screens for "Play," "Train," "Clock," and "Settings."

Here are some key points from the `BottomTabs.tsx` file:

- The `BottomTabs` component uses `createBottomTabNavigator` from `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`.
- Each tab is associated with a screen component, such as `PlayScreen`, `TrainScreen`, `ClockScreen`, and `SettingsScreen`.
- The tab bar style and label styles are defined in the `screenOptions`.

If you are not seeing the changes in the bottom tabs, it could be due to several reasons:

1. **Component Updates**: Ensure that the components associated with each tab (like `PlayScreen`, `TrainScreen`, etc.) have been updated with the changes you expect to see.

2. **Navigation Setup**: Verify that the `BottomTabs` component is correctly integrated into your app's navigation structure. It should be rendered in a parent navigator or screen.

3. **State Management**: If the tabs rely on any state or props, ensure that the state is being managed correctly and that the components are receiving the expected props.

Would you like me to check the integration of the `BottomTabs` component in the main application file or any specific screen?
