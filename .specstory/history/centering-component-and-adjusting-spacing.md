This component is not coming in the center please keep it in center, also add some spacing between timers and board.

I'll help you center the component and add proper spacing between the timers and the board. Let me modify the styles to achieve better layout and spacing.

I'll edit the `GameScreen.tsx` file to update the styles:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 16,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  clockContainer: {
    marginVertical: 16,
    borderRadius: 8,
    borderWidth: 1,
    elevation: 1,
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: {width: 0, height: 1},
    shadowOpacity: 0.1,
    shadowRadius: 2,
    width: '100%',
  },
// ... existing code ...
});
```

---

_**Assistant**_

I've made the following changes to improve the layout:

1. Added `justifyContent: 'center'` and `alignItems: 'center'` to the container to center all content
2. Increased the `marginVertical` of the clock containers from 4 to 16 to add more spacing between the timers and the board
3. Added `width: '100%'` to the clock containers to ensure they maintain full width while the content is centered

These changes will:
- Center the entire game board and controls in the screen
- Add more breathing room between the timers and the chess board
- Maintain proper alignment of the timer containers while keeping everything centered

The chess board should now be perfectly centered on the screen with proper spacing between the timers above and below it. The layout should look more balanced and visually appealing.
