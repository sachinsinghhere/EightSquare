_**User**_

Please take your time understanding the code base.

In the entire codebase, scan each file and directory and remove each and every, unused import , code, file & unused dependencies of package.json.

Get rid of redundant code, add useful comments.

Create a folder structure following feature first pattern, do not make it complex keep it simple to understand and grasp. 

Better use functional programming.

I'll help you clean up your codebase by removing unused imports, code, files, and dependencies. I'll also restructure the code following a feature-first pattern and add useful comments. Let's start by exploring the codebase to understand its structure.

First, let's look at the root directory to get an overview of the project:

Now, let's look at the package.json to understand the dependencies:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Let's examine the src directory to understand the project structure:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_





Let's look at the App.tsx file to understand the main application structure:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_





Let's check the index.js file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now, let's look at the navigation structure:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Let's examine the AppNavigator.tsx:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_









Let's check the routes.ts file:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_









Let's look at the bottom tabs:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_









Let's examine the BottomTabs.tsx:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











Now, let's look at the features directory:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











Let's check the screens directory:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_













Let's check the shared directory:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_













Let's look at the play feature:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_















Let's look at the play screen:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Let's try again:

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_





Let's try a different approach. Let's look at the PlayScreen directly:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Let's try to understand the settings feature:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_









Let's try to look at the theme context:

---

_**Assistant**_

_**Assistant**_









It seems we're having some issues accessing certain directories. Let's try a different approach by using grep to find unused imports:

---

_**Assistant**_

_**Assistant**_











Let's try a more targeted approach. Let's check the ChessClockSelection.tsx file since it seems to be in the screens directory but there's also a clock feature directory:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_











It seems we're having issues accessing the files. Let's try a different approach by running a terminal command to list all files in the project:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
find . -type f -name "*.ts*" | grep -v "node_modules" | sort
```
