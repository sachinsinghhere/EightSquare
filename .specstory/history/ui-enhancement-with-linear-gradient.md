## UI Enhancement with Linear Gradient (3/8/2025, 5:13:05 PM)

_**User**_

can we use react-native-svg to improve this wrapper as a galaxy? use @ThemeContext.tsx for the colors that will change as per theme. By doing  this i want to give this a wrapper space full of stars like feel.

Please note, this should not break any current implementation.

I'll help you enhance the `ScreenWrapper` component by adding a galaxy-like background with stars using react-native-svg. First, let me check if we have react-native-svg installed and then make the necessary changes.

Let me search for any existing SVG implementations first.
