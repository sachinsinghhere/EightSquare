### Update `package.json`

You need to add the new dependencies to your `package.json`. Hereâ€™s how the updated section would look:

```json:package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // existing dependencies...
    "axios": "^0.21.1",
    "react-redux": "^7.2.6",
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.15.6",
    "redux-persist": "^6.0.0",
    "redux-saga": "^1.1.3",
    "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.6.0",
    "moment": "^2.29.1",
    "lottie-react-native": "^3.5.0",
    "react-native-shimmer-placeholder": "^2.0.0",
    "react-native-linear-gradient": "^2.5.6",
    "@react-native-community/netinfo": "^8.0.0",
    "@gorhom/bottom-sheet": "^3.1.0"
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Install Packages

After updating `package.json`, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
cd ios
pod install
```

### Summary of Changes
1. Added the specified packages to the `dependencies` section of `package.json`.
2. Suggested running `npm install` and `pod install` to install the new packages.

how to patch this package ? 

"react-native-chessboard": "FirePlank/react-native-chessboard",

---

_**Assistant**_

To patch a package like `react-native-chessboard` that is installed from a GitHub repository, you can use the `patch-package` library. This allows you to make modifications to the package and keep those changes even after reinstalling dependencies. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Step 1: Install `patch-package`

If you haven't already installed `patch-package`, you can do so by running:

```bash
yarn add patch-package
```

### Step 2: Modify the Package

1. Navigate to the `node_modules/react-native-chessboard` directory.
2. Make the necessary changes to the files in that directory.

### Step 3: Create a Patch

After making your changes, run the following command to create a patch file:

```bash
npx patch-package react-native-chessboard
```

This will create a patch file in the `patches` directory at the root of your project, named something like `react-native-chessboard+<version>.patch`.

### Step 4: Update `package.json`

Make sure to add a post-install script to your `package.json` to apply the patch automatically after installing dependencies. Add the following line to the `scripts` section:

```json:package.json
"scripts": {
  // existing scripts...
  "postinstall": "patch-package"
}
```

### Summary of Steps

1. Install `patch-package`.
2. Modify the `react-native-chessboard` package in `node_modules`.
3. Create a patch using `npx patch-package`.
4. Add a post-install script to `package.json` to apply the patch automatically.

### Example of Updated `package.json`

Hereâ€™s how the relevant part of your `package.json` might look after adding the post-install script:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "android": "react-native run-android",
    "ios": "react-native run-ios",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "start": "react-native start",
    "test": "jest",
    "postinstall": "patch-package"
  },
  // ...
}
```

Now, whenever you run `yarn install`, the patch will be applied automatically, ensuring your changes to `react-native-chessboard` are preserved.
