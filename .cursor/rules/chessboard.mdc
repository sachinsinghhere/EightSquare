Everything you follow related to chess board follow links below 

https://github.com/enzomanuelmangano/react-native-chessboard (For the render of chess board in react-native-cli) [PlayScreen.tsx](mdc:src/features/play/screens/PlayScreen.tsx) has the decent implementation of it.

https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md ( For performing any chess related logic use it's built in methods)

Follow package.json before adding any dependency, if some linting issues can be ignored then ignore them. 

Before implementing any thing check if it exists already, be it screen, component, utils, service, etc.
